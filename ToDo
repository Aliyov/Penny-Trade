Few things have to be added and bugs have to fixed.

Short term Todo:
1. I have to check if it is possible to write python code that 
    clean up firsttactic output which is selling and buying points logs. 
2. If possible i should run data_cleaner and C codes together in with scripts.
3. If this is not useful solution then i have to try to write data_cleaner in C also.
4. I have to find good news API for data collecting for AI model. 
5. I have to learn how json data works and how python interracts with it.
6. If news part somehow work then it would be good practice to send news telegram bot. 
7. And if possible in near future user will accept if news should affect probability or not.
