As the saying goes, “A good chin is one of the most valuable assets a fighter can have.” While the origin of this quote is uncertain, it rings true for many fighters, particularly in the world of MMA. One UFC fighter who has undeniably earned a reputation for possessing a granite chin is former featherweight champion Max Holloway. Since joining the UFC in 2012, ‘Blessed’, now 33 years old, has shown no signs of slowing down.
Holloway’s UFC stint has earned him a reputation for withstanding brutal strikes and still going forward. This remarkable durability has led many to wonder how the Hawaiian native can endure such devastating punches, even without the typical “strong chin” seen in other fighters. During Episode #2249 of his JRE podcast, Joe Rogan recently discussed ‘Blessed’s’ resilience with comedians Yannis Pappas and Chris Distefano. The podcaster humorously teased Pappas about his “easier-to-hurt” chin during their conversation.
Subsequently, Rogan then took a moment to reflect on Max Holloway’s extraordinary toughness. He pointed out that although ‘Blessed’ doesn’t possess the typical “big, square jaw” that is often associated with fighters who can take a punch, his ability to absorb hits is unparalleled. As the podcaster remarked, “There are certain faces that are easier to hurt. There are arguments against that, like some guys have small jaws, and somehow or another, they take great punches. Max Holloway doesn’t have a big, square jaw, but he takes a tremendous punch.”

Rogan’s observation rings true, as Holloway has etched his name in UFC history as one of the most resilient fighters, enduring an astounding 2,298 significant strikes throughout his career. Holloway’s chin finally met its match at UFC 308. In a hard-fought three-round battle, at the 1:34 mark of the third round, Ilia Topuria sent the Hawaiian crashing into the canvas, breaking his undefeated streak of never being knocked out.
Nevertheless, it’s essential to remember that Holloway had withstood many powerful strikes from some of the toughest opponents in the sport, including Alexander Volkanovski, and no one had managed to break his chin before. One knockout loss is not enough to cast doubt on Holloway’s “iron chin.” Rogan, like many others, remains a fan of Holloway’s toughness. In fact, he was so impressed by Holloway’s performance at UFC 300 that he couldn’t help but praise him. Let’s hear it directly from the podcaster.

He went on to say, “That’s the greatest knockout of all time. With so many people counting him out, with so many people thinking he was outgunned, with so many people thinking he wouldn’t have a chance against the firepower of Justin Gaethje, the fact that he called for that…out on one of the most dangerous men to ever fight in the sport.”
